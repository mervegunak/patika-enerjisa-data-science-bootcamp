# **Patika.dev - Data Structures and Algorithms Module Projects**


### 1- [Insertion Sort Project](https://github.com/mervegunak/patika-enerjisa-data-science-bootcamp/blob/main/Patika_Mod%C3%BCl_1/insertion_sort.md)

    A = [22,27,16,2,18,6]
  
1. Write the stages of the array according to the sort type.
2. Write the Big-O notation.
3. Time Complexity:
    * Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle,
    * Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end,
    * Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the array.
4. After the series is sorted, which case does the number 18 fall into?
5. X = [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] Write the first 4 steps according to insertion sort.

### 2- [Merge Sort Project](https://github.com/mervegunak/patika-enerjisa-data-science-bootcamp/blob/main/Patika_Mod%C3%BCl_1/merge_sort.md)

    B = [16,21,11,8,12,22]  

1.Write the stages of the array according to the sort type.

2.Write the Big-O notation.

### 3- [Binary Search Tree Project](https://github.com/mervegunak/patika-enerjisa-data-science-bootcamp/blob/main/Patika_Mod%C3%BCl_1/binary_search_tree.md)

    C = [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2]
    
1. Write Binary-Search-Tree steps.
2. Write the Big-O notation.
